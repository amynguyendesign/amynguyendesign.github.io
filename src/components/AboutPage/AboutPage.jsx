        <p>
          I entered Stanford with a background in writing and literature, but
          chose to pursue Computer Science because I wanted to push
          myself toward a type of intellectual challenge I hadn’t yet mastered.
        </p>

        <p>
          With no prior technical experience, I started from scratch: multivariable calculus, first-order logic, my first lines of code. I gained a new mental framework that rewired how I solve problems and build solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I work at the intersection of software engineering and product design. I take pride in my work and am dedicated to perfecting my craft. Drawn to patterns: visual, conceptual and structural, I have a gut feeling for how things align, when they work, and where they break.
        </p>

        <p>I also care deeply about aesthetics, and about the quiet magic that comes from things crafted with intention.</p>

        <p>
        I thrive at the intersection of disciplines. A poly-hyphenate, if you will. Ultimately though, I just want to understand as many jokes from as many fields as possible •ᴗ•
