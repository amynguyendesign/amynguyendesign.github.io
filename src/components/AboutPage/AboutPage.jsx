        <p>
        When I was a kid, I had this oddly specific image in my head: me, customizing buttons on a pink Y2K-style UI — no idea what I was doing, just making it feel right. I was always that kid who could fix the family computer, troubleshoot the phone. But what I was really known for was writing — language came naturally to me, so the rest of my education leaned toward the humanities.        </p>

        <p>
        But there were other parts of me, too — the side that admired cold logic and problem-solving, and the one quietly obsessed with aesthetics. These were parts I watched from afar, always in awe — parts I wasn’t sure I was smart enough for.        </p>

        <p>
        After my first quarter at Stanford studying what had always come naturally, I realized it would be a waste of my four years not to challenge myself. I’ve always felt a deep reverence for knowledge — a quiet love of learning, an academic devotion rooted in the intellectual pursuit itself. So I pivoted to Computer Science.        </p>

        <p>
          I took the plunge and didn’t let myself second-guess it. With absolutely no coding background and zero AP credits, I started over — taking Calculus I, Physics I, writing my first line of code, and slowly training myself to think algorithmically. That wasn’t easy. As good as I am with words, numbers never came as naturally. I’d always been good enough at math to maintain a high GPA and score well on standardized tests, but I never thought I was cut out for Stanford Math. Or for Stanford Engineering, for that matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          But step by step, I got closer to that vision I’d had as a kid (where did it come from? I still don’t know). Now I’m proud to call myself an engineer — proud to have built a solid frame for problem-solving, proud to have leaned into every part of myself. I turned a way of thinking that once felt unfamiliar into something that now feels like home.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love patterns. Whether it’s a clever UI, a well-written sentence, or a moment of symmetry in a system — I notice it. I know when something just feels right. 
        </p>
      <p>I’ve never been just one thing — and I’ve stopped trying to be.</p>
        <p>
          Ultimately though, I just want to understand jokes from as many fields as possible. JK. Unless.
